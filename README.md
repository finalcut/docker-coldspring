docker-coldspring
=================

Docker container that contains coldspring 1-2 final (not the latest release). exposed at /tmp/coldspring

Switching this to using coldspring 2.0alpha is something I don't plan on doing.  Any other ColdFusion project I have that would use DI and AOP will use FW/1 and the [finalcut/framework-one container](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/finalcut/framework-one/).
